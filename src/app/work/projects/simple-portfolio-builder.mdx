## Overview

Implementation of a privacy-preserving facial recognition attendance system using Federated Learning (FL), ensuring data security and compliance with privacy regulations.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Model Training**: Utilized Federated Learning to train facial recognition models across multiple edge devices without transmitting sensitive biometric data to a central server.
- **Enhanced Privacy & Security**: Leveraged differential privacy and secure aggregation techniques to prevent unauthorized access to facial data.
- **Optimized Attendance Verification**:Implemented lightweight facial recognition algorithms for real-time attendance logging while reducing computational overhead.
- **Edge Device Compatibility**: Designed for deployment on mobile devices, embedded systems, and local servers, ensuring seamless integration into various infrastructures.
- **Adaptive Learning Mechanism**:Enabled continuous model improvement through on-device learning updates while maintaining user privacy.

## Technologies Used

- **Federated Learning**:To enable decentralized model training across distributed nodes.
- **TensorFlow Federated (TFF)**: For building and orchestrating FL-based facial recognition models.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time face detection and preprocessing.
- **PyTorch**: For model training and optimization.
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**: To enhance data privacy during training.
- **Mediapipe**: For lightweight and efficient facial feature extraction.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was ensuring model convergence while maintaining privacy constraints. To address this, we fine-tuned communication strategies between client devices and the central aggregator to minimize data transmission while preserving accuracy. Another learning was optimizing facial recognition models to function efficiently on resource-limited edge devices without compromising performance.
## Outcome

The Federated Learning-based facial recognition attendance system significantly improved privacy and security, eliminating centralized biometric storage risks. It also enhanced the scalability of attendance tracking solutions, making it suitable for institutions and enterprises requiring privacy-compliant authentication mechanisms. The system has demonstrated successful deployment with real-world datasets, ensuring accuracy while maintaining regulatory compliance.
